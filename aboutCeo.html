            PROJECTS OF GLOWLINK AND THEIR IMPACT
          </h3>
          <p>
            Glorious Women’s Linkage (GLOWLINK) focuses on mentoring girls and
            women in general, and educating them on the need to be responsible
            by pressing for progress in every endeavour of their lives thereby
            occupying their places in life and staying focused in the pursuit of
            their goals. From the establishment of the organization to date, we
            have been able to mentor five thousand (5000) girls and women.
            GLOWLINK under my leadership has seen tremendous transformation in
            the lives of many people including its members.
          </p>

          <p>
            In <strong>2016</strong>, I led GLOWLINK to organize a mentorship
            programme in the Central Region of Ghana, precisely in Cape Coast to
            educate one hundred (100) students on the importance of
            self-identity and how to achieve excellent results.
          </p>
          <p>
            In <strong>2016</strong>, the organization embarked on a street
            donations in Accra. This exercise focused on the head potters on the
            streets of Tema Station (a popular station in Accra central).
            Sanitary products and some food items were donated to the potters. I
            was able to use my influence to invite some specialists to educate
            the head potters on pursuing their dreams irrespective of their
            gender. They were made aware that being a woman does not prevent
            them from achieving their purpose. They were also educated on
            sanitation issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            In <strong>2017</strong>, the organization visited Anglican Junior
            High School and Riverside Academy respectively in the Ashanti Region
            of Ghana to educate three hundred (300) girls in both schools on how
            to study effectively to attain good results and overcome low
            self-esteem. After the training, I led my team to donate Exercise
            books, Text books and other stationery to the students to help
            improve their studies.
          </p>
          <p>
            In <strong>2018</strong>, with the support of GLOWLINK we were able
            to get two thousand (2000) girls back to school through educational
            seminars. We also organized an empowerment outreach in September,
            2018 in the Northern Region of Ghana where early girl child marriage
            is rampant. The indigenes were educated on the need to allow the
            girl child to go to school. A vocational training was organized by
            me for about one hundred and fifty (150) parents whose children are
            victims of the early child marriage. This was done in order to give
            these parents financial independence so they will have something to
            depend on rather than using their children as a means to alleviate
            poverty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Again, under my leadership, the organization held an
            entrepreneurship training for one thousand (1000) widows, single
            mothers and youths in Cape Coast on the campus of the University of
            Cape Coast in 2018 to equip them with skills that can help them
            generate money to take care of their basic needs in order to reduce
            social issues like armed robbery and prostitution in the society. We
            believe this training will reduce the unemployment rate in the
            country to some extent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, GLOWLINK embarked on an outreach programme in Nima, a
            suburb of Accra, Ghana which I spearheaded the education of members
            of the community on sanitation and living a hygienic life to reduce
            infections. After the education they were taken through medical
            screening. Over three hundred (300) women were screened for
            hepatitis b, diabetes and breast cancer to see if they are at risk
            for any of these diseases.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once again, under my leadership GLOWLINK had another donation in
            Nungua also a suburb of Accra, Ghana to dine with a hundred (100)
            orphans at New Life Orphanage. It was amazing to play games and
            worship with these orphans. It was simply fun being with the kids.
            Our next donation was in Ankaful prison in Cape Coast (Central
            Region, Ghana) to dine with the prisoners and share the word of God
            with them. This was in November, 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            In <strong>2019</strong>, GLOWLINK embarked on a donation exercise
            at Nsawam prison, in the Eastern region of Ghana to help four
            hundred (400) prisoners with some basic needs. We provided health
            care products for the female inmates. During the exercise, the
            prisoners informed us about their need for some medications. We have
            not yet been able to provide them with the medications due to
            financial constraints of the organization. However, we are
            requesting for support from pharmaceutical companies and individuals
            who are willing to assist us so we can provide the necessary help to
            the prisoners and other less privileged people in our society at
            large. I have been following up on this to ensure that the needs of
            the less privileged are met.
          </p>
          <p>
            I saw the need to reach out to the elderly men and women in our
            society hence, in November 2021, we organized a donation exercise at
            the TABITHA AGED CARE CENTER at Afiama, Accra. The ministry donated
            food items and toiletries to one hundred (100) aged men and women
            and shared the word of God with them. The aged felt happy knowing
            that there was a group of people who cared about them and was
            willing to spend time with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            In <strong>2020</strong>, due to the Covid-19 pandemic a lot of
            activities came to a halt. However, being in leadership and trying
            to set an example for the people we mentor, I had to come up with
            innovative measures, we therefore held many of our programmes
            virtually. We held virtual Conferences to empower our members and
            women in general to help them overcome fear and panic which had
            engulfed many. Speakers were invited globally to speak to our
            audience. This proved very useful and rendered our programmes a
            success.
          </p>
          <p>
            In <strong>August 2021</strong>, the organization had a programme on
            Menstrual Education at Jakobu Community, in the Ashanti Region,
            Ghana. We educated girls from ten (10) different schools on how to
            use sanitary pads. We also educated them on healthy practices to
            keep during their menstruation period. The girls were also given a
            talk on the Importance of Education to enable them deepen their
            desire for education and remain focused on their studies.
          </p>
          <p>
            We held our first annual conference in
            <strong>January, 2022</strong> to empower women globally about their
            potentials and how to make good use of it. The programme was a great
            success with global speakers on board.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our second annual program was a Summit which was held in
            <strong>May, 2022</strong> dubbed GLOBE4HER. We invited speakers
            like Dr. Joyce Aryee, Mrs. Comfort Ocran, Madam Catherine Krobo
            Edusie and Ms. Valarie Waswa, a Kenyan lawyer to educate girls and
            women on the importance of global impact and the need for women to
            make impact globally. The programme had a tremendous impact on our
            members and the general public. I was very instrumental in the
            selection of the speakers since we wanted our audience to be
            enriched with knowledge from persons who have the technical
            knowledge on the theme of the programme.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third annual program for 2022 is a Mentorship programme which
            will be held on 25th June. It will also feature Menstrual advocacy
            and donations. The programme is scheduled to hold at Aseseeso, a
            village in the Okere District in the Eastern Region of Ghana. We see
            the need to educate the young girls of Asesseso and their parents on
            the need to educate the girl child and also enlighten them about
            their menstrual health and its associated implications. We will also
            educate the youth. Our feasibility studies show that drug abuse is
            fast rising in the community, if nothing is done about it the lives
            of the younger generation in the Asesseso village will be in
            jeopardy. GLOWLINK will therefore cease the opportunity to educate
            the youth in general on the dangers of drug abuse and the need to
            abstain from the use of hard drugs.
          </p>
          <p>
            My team and I realized that many families have neglected their
            family members who are not mentally sound in the Psychiatric
            hospitals. Therefore, this year (2022), our last annual program for
            the year is a donation exercise at Accra Psychiatric hospital. The
            purpose of this programme is to donate sanitary items, foodstuffs
            and toiletries to support people with mental illness. We will also
            worship with them and pray for their recovery.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is worth mentioning that, GLOWLINK has been invited by various
            Radio and Television stations to be part of talk shows. Some of the
            stations include Y FM, Orange FM, Okay FM, Hello FM, Sharp FM,
            Spirit FM and Kessben TV all in Ghana. Some of the issues on which
            we were invited to talk on are teenage pregnancy, self-identity,
            temperament of women and girls, igniting leadership skills in women
            among others. GLOWLINK saw these invitations as opportunies to
            educate women and the general public. We therefore took advantage of
            the opportunity to make an impact on everyone who tuned into the
            programme. In most of these shows my executives nominated me to
            represent the organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to state that members of GLOWLINK are all over the
            country. I therefore introduced regional programmes. We hold
            regional conferences annually to enable members of the various
            regions to meet each other physically at their respective regions
            and get acquainted with each other. The conference is also aimed at
            empowering the members with leadership skills which they will in
            turn use to empower other younger ladies or girls.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apart from the programmes mentioned above, we organize weekly
            activities for our members to equip them with the requisite
            knowledge and skills to be able to mentor and monitor the progress
            of the children we mentor. The organization takes its members
            through Bible study and prayer on Tuesdays and Thursdays
            respectively. Members of the organization have been put into
            different groups. Each group is given a schedule to lead both Bible
            study and prayer on specific dates that are allocated to them. This
            is done to meet members’ spiritual needs. On Saturdays, there is a
            presentation by either a member of the organization or an invited
            guest who talks on various issues to educate members. Some of the
            issues include education, health, entrepreneurship, decency,
            development of self-confidence, marriage, parenting among others. On
            Sundays, members are encouraged to share what they learned at church
            with the entire group on our WhatsApp group page. Some members have
            dedicated themselves to write devotions which are shared daily on
            the page to help members start their day on a good note.

            In conclusion, I aspire to see GLOWLINK reach out to as many people
            as possible all over the world. In view of that, there is an ongoing
            exercise to recruit country directors from all African countries to
            expand the scope of the organization and allow many girls, women and
            even men to benefit from the impact that we are making in the lives
            of people.
